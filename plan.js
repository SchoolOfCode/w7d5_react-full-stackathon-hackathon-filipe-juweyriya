//TASK 1
// Use Pokemon API
// MVP display image - name - id # for each pokemon
// Have a button that fetches all pokemon
// stretch goal - add more pokemon features and enable search parameters such as (speed,abilities,attacks)

// IDEATE & PLAN
// Landing page with pokemon logo & button that says 'gotta catch them all'
// After pressing button takes you to the main page where all pokemon cards are displayed all at once.
// focus on MVP(look above) and then spend the rest of the time doing CSS/ animations for landing page( pokemon ball animation)

// build mvp
// useEffect to fetch api data
// useState to change data/id on everycard
//useRouter to change from landing page to main page ( will need at least 2 components)
// App(main component/page)
// ButtonComponent( get all pokemon button )
// PokemonCards(will display all 950 pokemon cards)
// push it to git as early as possible and connect to netlify( updates will be done automatically )
